# clojure_stat

A Clojure library designed to summarize data.  Summarizing a dataset is one of the most fundamental operations you can do in order to detect patterns and trends. Clojure is a great, general purpose programming language that can be very useful in data analytics. In this repository, I introduce a function that allows a user to summarize a dataset using custom partitions.

## Usage

This small library was intended for ad-hoc data analytics using the Clojure programming language.
